## 💡 Future Improvements

-   [ ] **Merge Applications:** Combine both projects into a single multi-tabbed Tkinter application.
-   [ ] **Data Persistence:** Save data to a local file (e.g., SQLite, JSON, or CSV) so it persists between sessions.
-   [ ] **Export Functionality:** Add a feature to export contacts or expenses to a CSV/Excel file.
-   [ ] **Search & Filter:** Implement search and filter capabilities for easier data management in both apps.
-   [ ] **UI Enhancements:** Improve the user interface with better styling and custom themes.
